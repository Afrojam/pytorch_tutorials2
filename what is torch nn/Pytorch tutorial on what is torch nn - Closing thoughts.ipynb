    "We now have a general data pipeline and training loop which you can use for training many types of models using Pytorch. To see how simple training a model can now be, take a look at the mnist_sample sample notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are many things you’ll want to add, such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, monitoring training, transfer learning, and so forth. These features are available in the fastai library, which has been developed using the same design approach shown in this tutorial, providing a natural next step for practitioners looking to take their models further.\n",

    "We promised at the start of this tutorial we’d explain through example each of torch.nn, torch.optim, Dataset, and DataLoader. So let’s summarize what we’ve seen:\n",
    "\n",
    "torch.nn:\n",
    "    Module: creates a callable which behaves like a function, but can also contain state(such as neural net layer weights). It knows what Parameter (s) it contains and can zero all their gradients, loop through them for weight updates, etc.\n",
    "    Parameter: a wrapper for a tensor that tells a Module that it has weights that need updating during backprop. Only tensors with the requires_grad attribute set are updated\n",
    "    functional: a module(usually imported into the F namespace by convention) which contains activation functions, loss functions, etc, as well as non-stateful versions of layers such as convolutional and linear layers.\n",
    "        \n",
    "torch.optim: Contains optimizers such as SGD, which update the weights of Parameter during the backward step\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset: An abstract interface of objects with a __len__ and a __getitem__, including classes provided with \n",

    "Pytorch such as TensorDataset\n",
    "        DataLoader: Takes any Dataset and creates an iterator which returns batches of data.\n",
